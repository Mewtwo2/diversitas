<h1>Diversitas</h1>

<p>This is a website that attempts to list the ideal PC builds for varying use purposes. It is not meant to let you create a build yourself, rather to let me do the work for you and offer a pre configured set of parts that would work best for each category. All you have to do is order the parts and build it. <br><br>
All the site functionality does work however the content of the lists themselves and some functionality is still being refined so I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage anyone visiting the site to take the lists with a grain of salt.
